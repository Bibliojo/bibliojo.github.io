excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am currently the Head, Research & Scholarly Communication, Western Libraries, Western University. I oversee a team of librarians who support activities throughout the research process, such as copyright, author rights, open access, GIS, and research data management. Previously I was a metadata librarian and the Coordinator of Western Libraries open access Institutional Repository, Scholarship@Western (S@W).  As such, I fielded inquiries from faculty, staff, and students about Scholarship@Western, and promoted S@W programs and services.
I am keenly interested in digital curation and digital preservation, and I draw on my background in musicology and the humanities to support digital projects.

Recently I have rekindled my love of trumpet playing and have joined several bands. I also am learning to play the Euphonium through the New Horizons Band program, mostly so that I can participate in the annual [Tuba Christmas concert](http://www.tubachristmas.com/)!
