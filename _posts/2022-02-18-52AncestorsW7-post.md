## Week 7: Change of tactic

It's time for a reboot! I want to set aside time to organise that data that I have, inspect every document for each scrap of information, and create datasets for visualisation. I joined this challenge to share a bit of what I am working on and to start to get organised and to get better at tracking the work that I do. and while the weekly themes are fun and one can, of course, be as creative as one wishes, I think from now on I am just going to focus on one individual per week, and ensure that I have as much info on them as I can find online. In that way I can then seek out to fill in gaps from archives searches.
I want to find interesting ways to show this data, beyond the family tree.

For each of the 52 individuals do I have the basics, the vital stats. Can if find out where they live, went to school, what occupations they may have held. Was there any newsworthy activity? Once I pull this all together, I can see what gaps there may be in my knowledge  and I can then attempt to fill that in.

I also want to learn more about how DNA can help. Using the Leeds method, I have started to chart out some relationships, but I have yet to figure out what those might mean.
