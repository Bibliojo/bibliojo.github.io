## Week um, shrug. The best laid plans

It's time for a reboot reboot!
My plan has got slightly off the rails and now I am getting back to it. I am currently on a research leave continuing to focus on genealogy and data visualisations. I have a few ideas to pursue and getting the data organised in a first action. I have come to see the great value in having a research log, and I ma working my thoughts through a data management plan (DMP).
