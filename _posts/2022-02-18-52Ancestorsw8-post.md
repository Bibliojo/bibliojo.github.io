## Week um, shrug. The best laid plans

It's time for a reboot reboot!
My plan has got slightly off the rails and now I am getting back to it. I am currently on a research leave continuing to focus on genealogy and data visualisations. I have a few ideas to pursue and getting the data organised is a first action. I have come to see the great value in having a research log, and I am working my thoughts through a data management plan (DMP).

The research log helps me remember where and what I have searched. If a database or other entity has new releases or updated material, I can check to see when I searched, so that I can pursue new leads. It also lets me know what I have. there have been a few times when I have requested a purchased a document that I already had! a waste of time and money :(

Consistent file naming is important, as is making the filenames meaningful. Though it takes time to notate and organise the documents as you find them,, it does make everything easier in the long run.
