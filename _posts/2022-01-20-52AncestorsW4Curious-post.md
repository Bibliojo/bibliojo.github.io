## Week 3: Curious

I am curious about so many things.
In fact there are so many, that I need a research log to keep track.

![Genealogy Research Log created in Excel by Thomas MacEntee](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PAADC5XkLINPktjuacfxr0f6RcL_C0DO_3g-d8bhzWQ/edit#gid=1096784801  "Research Log")

The best research log is the one that you use. :)
