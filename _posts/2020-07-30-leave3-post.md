There is a weird apple thing .DS_Store that appears with files. I am not sure but it may have been what was mucking up my previous site. I tried for most of the day to "fix" it, scanning stack overflow and code girl and other usual places to find solutions. and *I was stuck!*
Nothing seemed to work. So I decided to just blow it up and start over. Which is actually an excellent learning experience. I feel a bit more confident in what I am doing and it reinforces some of the things that I have learned. I definitely learn through mistakes!

## How is this site different?
Because I should have kept a copy of the entries on the site, and didn't, I am recreating this from memory -- and mine these days is faulty at best! And so this is a recreation and update to my last version. And that's okay because this is really a means for me to learn and do things, a playground for me to improve my own digital literacy, so that I can then help others. I hope to lead a workshop on some of the things I have toyed with over the last eight weeks.
whoa! Google cache to the rescue! ( to find out some of the things I wrote previously )
