## Week 4: Curiosity (DRAFT)
am curious about so many things.
In fact there are so many, that I need a research log to keep track.

It 's a good idea to keep track of:
data points you are missing, such as your step-Uncle's birthdate, or great grandparents marriage date, etc.
consider where you might look
write down where you have already looked
doing so may save you time and money. I am embarrassed to say that I have purchased the same document twice, because I forgot that I had done so already.

There are probably as many research logs as there are researchers. The best research log is the one that you use. :)
