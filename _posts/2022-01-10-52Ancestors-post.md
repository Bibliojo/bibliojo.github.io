## Week 1: Foundations

My sister was the one who began the family history journey. She had always a keen interest in local history and she began to piece together documents.
And while she focused on our maternal line, I decided to pick up the paternal lineage.  My obsession began in particular when I worked at Canada's National Library and I happened upon this document:
![1832 Marriage Bond](http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e329/e008217379.jpg "Upper and Lower Canada marriage bonds 1779-1858")

I needed to know more. I was hooked!

## Week 2: Favourite Find
!["Breaking down a brick wall" ](https://dr.library.brocku.ca/handle/10464/9772 "Farm Account book 1821-1852)

David Pickel, my 4GreatGrandfather has been a brick wall for me for ages. The Ontario Township Papers available offer a tantalising clue. It mentions Matthew John as David's father, who likely died sometime in 1820.

Then while perusing some recently digitized farm account books At the Brock University archives, I found this page which metnions David and Mathias Pickle

Now to see where it leads me!
