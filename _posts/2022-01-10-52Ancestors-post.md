## Week 1: Foundations

My sister was the one who began the family history journey. She had always a keen interest in local history and she began to piece together documents.
Her work inspired me, and while she focused on our maternal line, I decided to pick up the paternal lineage.  My obsession began in particular when I worked at Canada's National Library and I happened upon this document:
![1832 Marriage Bond](http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e329/e008217379.jpg "Upper and Lower Canada marriage bonds 1779-1858")

The bond says that David Pickle married Catherine Renner in 1832 at Grimsby Ontario. Witness was her father William Renner who gave his mark X . and John Campbell was present ( there are campbells at a neighbouring farm.)
I needed to know more.
I was hooked!

## Week 2: Favourite Find

*[Farm Account book 1821-1852](https://dr.library.brocku.ca/handle/10464/9772)*

David Pickel, my 3xGreatGrandfather has been a brick wall for me for ages. The Ontario Township Papers available online offer a tantalising clue. (Though free, Family Search requires an account to log in) <https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSY9-79RK-F?i=299&cat=2759321> It mentions Matthew John as David's father, who likely died sometime in 1820.


Then while perusing some recently digitised farm account books at the Brock University archives, I found this page which mentions David and Mathias Pickle

David is given credit for three days work. and I am not sure who is recieiving or getting but I think Matthias has purchased a pound of salt? It puts these two together in the same area where David eventually married.
Now to see where it leads me!
