## Refresh 

### Continuing to exapnd and improve my digital skills
It’s been a few years since I set up this GitHub site, and I’m finally circling back to it. In the meantime, I’ve been experimenting with other platforms like Neocities and Zonelets for blogging, but I still want to keep this space alive and fresh—both as a record of my learning and as a place to share projects with others.

Recently, I finished Library Juice Academy’s “Advanced Python for Librarians” course. It built on the basics and dove into practical, library-specific applications of Python:

Retrieving and manipulating data from APIs like OCLC, ORCID, and local repositories

Data wrangling with Python libraries, sometimes alongside AI techniques

Best practices in coding—from GitHub sharing to running notebooks in Google Colab

The course reinforced something I’ve always believed: there’s a huge role for data science in librarianship. Whether it’s metadata cleanup, repository work, or new ways of analyzing information, these tools help us make systems better and more accessible.

This fall, I’ll also be co-offering workshops with Arielle, continuing to explore how coding and digital tools intersect with library work. Staying fresh with digital skills is an ongoing project, and I’m excited to keep learning—and sharing—as I go.
