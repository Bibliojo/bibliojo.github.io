### Creative Commons Certificate 2019
This was a great course and I highly recommend it. Throughout the course there are several projects that we needed to create to complete the certificate. For each one I also tried to use a new-to-me technology because I never follow my own advice of "Keep it simple". I felt many of my attempted projects were good starts, or decent drafts :)
Perhaps I will get time one day to improve them but I share them now as works in progress.
