## Week 3: Favourite Photograph

I think this photo is just charming.

![Hugh Burley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51833331350_1a61350976_b_d.jpg  "Hugh Burley, 1850-1922")

BIRTH 25 JUN 1850 • Haldimand, Northumberland, Ontario, Canada
DEATH 8 JUL 1922 • Hastings, Ontario, Canada

Hugh Burley, my 2nd great-grandfather, son of Samuel Burley and Chloe Barnes, married Hannah Mattis 5 Jun 1871 at Northumberland and Durham, Ontario. Hugh was 21, Hannah 22. She is from the Township of Camden. William and James Mattis were witnesses. They were married by [Davis Crowther?] and both are listed as E. Methodist. It says that Hugh was a farmer, but in later documents his occupation is listed as a jewler (sic). Wouldn't it be wonderful to find a piece of his handiwork? as usual I need to find out more.

One line of research that I am  currently invetsigating is the connections from Hannah Mattis too the UEL Jessups Ranger, Jacob Gordanier.
