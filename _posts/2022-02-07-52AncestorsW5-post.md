## Week 5: Branching Out
I'm behind!
branching out.
I think for me this means extending my skills et. I know how to search and what/where to find things, but know I am thinking in terms of how best to share my findings such as they are, in a a more data science-y way. Learning about how to develop social networking analysis and GIS mapping of things and people. I am looking at was to share these datasets  that i meaningful and useful for others. So, in the past I have created timeline and simple mappings, now I am looking to use Gephi to visualise a social network.  The first step is deciding how to set up the nodes and attributes, then think about relationships.
heads of Households are men, and most often landowners are men, so many famiily nodes will be centred on the father. also male or female as attributes. and How will I handle bigamy, wrong side of the blanket children and other interesting aspects.
